# GCodeSender.NET
##A GUI for grbl

Aims to work like winders UniversalGCodeSender, but will provide additional features such as [Autolevelling](https://github.com/martin2250/GrblHeightProbe2) or basic GCode refinement, translation (maybe scaling)

Supports Serial and Network Connections, can easily be expanded to just about every stream (eg Telnet, SSH, Bluetooth...)
